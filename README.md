  ~ Some random dev to their services in test/staging/prod, Feb. 1971

#   Motivation

Trying to debug an issue in your app but you never seem to get close
the services in your local/testing/staging/production environment?
Welcome to the Friend Zone.

#   Friendly Advice

Use this like you would social media:
  - Don't stalk other people/web services.
  - Don't put too much pressure on them.
  - Don't expect an immediate answer for every request.
  - You aren't entitled to anything. Unless you have an SLA, that is.

On second thought, better you don't use it like you do social media. You weirdo.
